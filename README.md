# CHIS2009

This is the Spring board GGplot 2 exercise.
This about Mosaic plots
It requires a data set from UCLA
I have used the CHIS 2009 data set 
The .dta file itself could not be uploaded due to size restrictions.
It would have resided in ./chis2009_adult_stata/chis2009_adult_stata/ADULT.rta

A few lines would need to be updated so that the read.rta of the rta file is to the correct data set.
